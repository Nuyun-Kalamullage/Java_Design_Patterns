### FACADE DESIGN PATTERN
___

### Properties
- **Structural** design pattern
- Used when you want to provide a simplified and unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Hides the complexities of the subsystem and presents a high-level interface.

### Implementation
- Involves the creation of a facade class that encapsulates the interactions with multiple subsystem classes.
- The facade class provides a simplified interface to the client, coordinating the actions and interactions with the subsystem.
- Enhances client code by abstracting away the complexities of the underlying system.

### Advantages
- Promotes loose coupling by providing a single entry point to the subsystem.
- Simplifies the client's interaction with a complex system, improving usability.
- Enables easier maintenance and changes to the subsystem without affecting client code.

### Disadvantages
- May not be suitable for systems requiring a high level of customization.
- Introducing a facade can hide important details that some clients may need.

### Use Case
- The Facade design pattern is applicable when you have a complex subsystem with numerous components, and you want to provide a simplified interface to clients.

### Example Scenario
- Consider a multimedia editing software with components for image processing, audio editing, and video rendering. A facade can provide a unified interface for common tasks, abstracting the intricacies of each subsystem.

### Application
- Widely used in scenarios where a system is composed of multiple subsystems, and a simplified entry point is needed for client code.
